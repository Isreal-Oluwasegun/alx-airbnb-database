# üè° ALX Airbnb Database Project

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Backend curriculum**, focusing on database design, normalization, schema definition, and data seeding. The goal is to build a scalable and normalized relational database system simulating an Airbnb-like platform.

---

## üìö Project Overview

This database system powers key functionalities for:
- User and Role management
- Property hosting and reviews
- Booking and payments
- Messaging between users

It follows industry best practices in normalization, referential integrity, and schema clarity.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Enforces **data integrity** via foreign keys and constraints
- Follows **3NF normalization**
- Includes **timestamp tracking** for auditing (created_at, updated_at)
- Implements **check constraints** for controlled enums (e.g., rating, status, payment type)

## üìÇ Sample Data

The database is pre-filled with realistic entries for:
- 4 Users (with roles: Host and User)
- 2 Properties in Nigeria (Lagos and Enugu)
- 2 Successful Bookings (with confirmed status)
- Reviews, Messages, and Payments across use cases
